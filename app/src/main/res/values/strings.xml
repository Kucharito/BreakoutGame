        ðŸŽ® Breakout â€“ Game Guide
        Objective of the game:
        Bounce the ball with the paddle and destroy all the bricks on the screen.
        Progress through the levels and score as many points as possible.

        Controls:
        Move the paddle: swipe your finger left or right across the screen.
        Rules:
        Destroying one brick gives you 10 points.
        After clearing all the bricks, you advance to the next level.
        The ball speeds up after several bounces.
        If the ball falls down, you lose a life and the ballâ€™s speed decreases.
        Tips:
        Try hitting the ball with different parts of the paddle â€“ this changes its direction.
        A faster ball lets you score more points in less time, but itâ€™s harder to catch.
